Time to try out pattern wildcarding!
If the subject being matched matches the pattern [(first, last), *info],
then info will capture all elements of the array after the first and last name.
For example, if you match [("Bob", "Belderbos"), "Pybite", "wrangler"] against the pattern [(first, last), *info]
then first == "Bob", last = "Belderbos" and info = ["Pybite", "wrangler"]

In this bite, you'll scan the file musicians.txt, with lines like this:

	Ron Sommers: guitar, fiddle: Grouchy Geezers, Junkyard Dogs

which says Ron Sommers plays guitar and fiddle, and has been in the bands "Grouchy Geezers" and "Junkyard Dogs" with me.

You'll print any lines that don't have colons, unchanged.
For anyone who plays more than three instruments, print
	"Paul plays more instruments than humanly possible."
For anyone who's been in more than two bands with me, print
	"Playing with George is habit-forming."
("John" and "George" are first names.)
Raise a ValueError for any musicians like Prince that don't have a last name.
